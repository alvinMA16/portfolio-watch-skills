# Feed Lifecycle

Feeds are persistent data pipelines. Use them whenever data needs freshness,
history, public reads, charts, playbook backing, push sidecars, or release.

For API detail and examples, read [feed-sdk.md](feed-sdk.md). For scheduled
jobs, read [deployment.md](deployment.md). For runtime constraints, read
[jagent-runtime.md](jagent-runtime.md).

## Lifecycle

Every feed follows the same path:

1. Write schema and incremental logic with `feed.def()` and
   `ctx.self.ts().append()`.
2. Upload source to `'~/feeds/<name>/v1/src/index.js'`.
3. Test with `alva run --entry-path '~/feeds/<name>/v1/src/index.js'`.
4. Grant the feed root for public reads when a playbook or public user needs it:
   `alva fs grant --path '~/feeds/<name>' --subject "special:user:*" --permission read`.
5. Deploy the script with `alva deploy create`.
6. Register the feed with `alva release feed` using the cronjob id from deploy.

`alva run` is a test step. It does not replace deploy or release and does not
guarantee public `@last` data for a playbook.

## Modeling

Use the Feed SDK for output data. Do not use `alfs.writeFile()` for feed data.

- Snapshot/latest-wins: current company detail, ratings, price target consensus.
  Stamp start-of-day and read `@last/1`.
- Event log: insider trades, news, filings. Use each event's natural timestamp.
- Tabular batch: top holders, estimate tables, screen results. Stamp all rows
  with the run time; same-date records are grouped.
- Time series: OHLCV, indicators, equity curves. Use bar or event timestamps.

`@last` returns chronological oldest-first order. `last(N)` limits unique
timestamps, not necessarily individual records when a timestamp has grouped
rows.

## Error Handling

Fail fast. Do not wrap data fetches, upstream reads, LLM parsing, or
`ctx.self.ts().append()` in `catch` blocks that log and continue with empty
arrays, nulls, fallback records, or partial outputs. Use ordinary conditionals
only for expected business states such as "no new records".

Throw meaningful errors:

```javascript
if (!equityRecords.length) {
  throw new Error("equityRecords empty: no aligned bars across " + TICKERS);
}
```

If a run fails with out-of-memory, retry with a larger `--max-heap-size-mb` (up
to 2048) before editing logic.

## HARD-GATE: before-feed-release

<HARD-GATE id="before-feed-release">
Before `alva release feed`, verify:

1. The exact feed script ran successfully in this session after the latest
   source write.
2. Output groups and fields match the feed contract.
3. Evidence is fresh; if source changed after the run, rerun.
4. `special:user:*` read permission exists on the feed root when public reads
   are needed.
5. An unauthenticated public read returns HTTP 200, not 403.
6. If the feed backs HTML, at least one public `@last` path the HTML reads has
   non-empty data after grant.

If any evidence is missing or stale, do not publish. Fix the feed, rerun, and
re-enter the gate.
</HARD-GATE>

## Push Sidecars

Push-capable feeds write one of these streams:

| Output stream    | Use                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `signal/targets` | Playbook signals, trading targets, actionable alerts.              |
| `notify/message` | Feed results, AlvaAsk reports, heartbeat checks, proactive alerts. |

Both dispatch `feed_alert_ready`. Do not use legacy names such as
`playbook_data_ready` or `feed_run_complete` in new docs.

`--push-notify` marks the cronjob publisher as capable of emitting alerts. It
does not subscribe any user or group and does not bypass notification
preferences. For `notify/message`, `<|SKIP_NOTIFICATION|>` advances fanout
without sending a visible push.

See [../alert-contract.md](../alert-contract.md) for the personal alert, group
subscription, and verification workflow.
