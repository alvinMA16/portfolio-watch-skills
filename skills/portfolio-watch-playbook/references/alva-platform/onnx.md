# ONNX Model

This reference covers the boundary between ML research artifacts and Alva
runtime inference. A request may start from a ready `.onnx` file, or from a
paper, report, notebook, or third-party methodology that still needs to be made
runnable before it can become a live playbook.

## From Method To Model

If the user provides a method instead of a ready model, first try to reproduce
the smallest faithful version in the sandbox or local R&D environment. Use real
Alva data where coverage exists, state source gaps clearly, and avoid treating a
paper result as a live signal until it passes a point-in-time split or
walk-forward check. Keep sandbox reproduction CPU-friendly: break the workflow
into small stages and simplify training before scaling fidelity. If reproduction
needs packages such as PyTorch, scikit-learn, or ONNX exporters, install them in
the sandbox and proceed.

Before writing inference code, freeze this handoff:

- thesis: asset/universe, prediction horizon, and decision use
- label: return, class, rank, allocation, or signal target
- features: raw fields, rolling windows, normalization, smoothing,
  missing-data policy, timestamp convention, and asset order
- tensor: input name, dtype, shape, flatten order, output name, and output
  semantics
- artifacts: `model.onnx` plus `model_meta.json`
- evidence: train/test split, metrics, costs, known failure modes, drift risks,
  and retraining or re-upload cadence

If the output is a strategy, rebalance rule, allocation model, or
portfolio-following signal, route the exported model through FeedAltra. Use a
plain Feed SDK pipeline only for prediction-only inspection.

## Runtime Inference

Production playbooks load uploaded models from ALFS inside an async entrypoint:

```javascript
const { InferenceSession, Tensor, TensorDataType } = require("@alva/onnx");

(async () => {
  const session = await InferenceSession.createFromAlfs({
    alfs,
    path: modelPath,
  });
  try {
    const outputs = await session.run({
      [inputName]: new Tensor(TensorDataType.Float32, featureVector, dims),
    });
    return outputs;
  } finally {
    await session.release();
  }
})();
```

Rules:

- Store production models under `~/models/<model>/v<major>/model.onnx` with
  `model_meta.json` beside it.
- Load production models with `InferenceSession.createFromAlfs({ alfs, path })`.
  Do not decode model bytes manually.
- Tensor dtype, shape, input names, and output names must come from
  `model_meta.json` or the training recipe.
- Create and release the ONNX session inside each scheduled run; release it in
  `finally`.

## Tensor Shapes

Tensor data is flat, and `dims` describes how the ONNX graph interprets that flat
array. The product of `dims` must equal the data length.

Common finance shapes:

| Use case | Typical shape | Flatten order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Single tabular row | `[1, features]` | `[f0, f1, ...]` |
| Multi-asset row | `[1, assets, features]` | asset-major, then feature order |
| OHLCV window | `[1, bars, 5]` | oldest-to-newest bars, each `[open, high, low, close, volume]` |
| Regression output | `[1, 1]` | `outputs.<name>.data[0]` |
| Classification output | `[1, classes]` | `Array.from(outputs.<name>.data)` |

Example:

```javascript
const tabular = new Tensor(
  TensorDataType.Float32,
  new Float32Array([f1, f2, f3, f4]),
  [1, 4],
);
```

## Model Artifacts

Keep model artifacts separate from feed/playbook outputs:

```text
~/models/<model-name>/v1/model.onnx
~/models/<model-name>/v1/model_meta.json
```

Use the directory version for the model contract major version: input names,
shapes, feature order, output semantics, and decision mapping. Put the exact
artifact version or hash in `model_meta.json`.

Do not grant public read on model artifacts unless the user explicitly wants to
share the model. Public playbooks expose feed outputs, not the `.onnx` file.

`model_meta.json` should include:

- model identity, contract version, artifact hash/version, source, training
  window, and task type
- data contract: universe, asset order, interval, timestamp convention, units,
  and missing-data policy
- input contract: input names, dtypes, dims, feature order, lookback, flatten
  order, normalization, scaler fit scope, and imputation policy
- output contract: output names, dtypes, dims, units/classes, horizon, class
  order, probability/logit semantics, thresholds, and sizing/no-trade rules
- validation evidence: train/validation/test or walk-forward windows, metrics,
  cost assumptions, limitations, drift risks, and retraining expectation

If input shape, feature order, normalization, or output meaning is missing, ask
the user before writing inference code.

## FeedAltra Inference

Use FeedAltra when ONNX output drives a backtest, rebalance, simulation, trading
signal, or strategy metric. That strategy workflow is outside this portfolio
watch skill's default scope; ONNX adds these constraints when the user
explicitly provides that separate strategy context:

- Create the session once per run, not once per bar.
- Reproduce training exactly: identifiers, intervals, bar-close timestamps,
  lookback, missing-data policy, feature order, scaling, target horizon, labels.
- The feature timestamp is the time input evidence is available, not the
  prediction horizon. Never use future bars to build the tensor for time `T`.
- Scalers and normalizers must be fitted on training data or rolling history
  available at or before `T`, never on the full backtest or live window.
- Do not read labels, future returns, future ranks, future volatility/drawdown,
  or other target-derived fields while building the inference tensor.
- `inputConfig` must request every evidence window needed by the model.

Inside an async feature function, keep the ONNX call explicit:

```javascript
const result = await session.run({
  [inputName]: new Tensor(TensorDataType.Float32, row.features, dims),
});
return { date: row.date, prediction: result[outputName].data[0] };
```

The input name, output name, dims, feature builder, and normalization must come
from `model_meta.json` or the user's training recipe. Raw model outputs are
predictions, not trading instructions; thresholds, no-trade bands, and position
sizing must also come from the model metadata or research recipe.

## Feed Outputs

ONNX inference does not create feed outputs by itself. Keep model artifacts under
`~/models/...`, and explicitly write only the derived prediction rows or summaries
that the playbook and downstream consumers need.

Recommended output groups, when the playbook needs them:

| Output | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `model/features` | Feature snapshot plus prediction rows for audit and charts |
| `model/summary` | Latest verdict, freshness, model version, compact chart arrays, diagnostics |
| `signal/targets` | Actionable target, if the model emits a trading signal |

If using FeedAltra, its normal `signal`, `sim`, and `perf` outputs are covered
by the separate Altra strategy workflow; do not duplicate them unless the
playbook needs a custom ONNX-specific view.

If released HTML displays ONNX predictions or metrics, it must read released
feed data at runtime. Preview fixtures must not become the authoritative source
or production fallback. These names are recommendations, not a required schema;
choose the smallest feed surface that supports the playbook and downstream
consumers.

## README And Release Additions

Follow the normal README and release rules in `SKILL.md` and
[api/release.md](api/release.md). ONNX only adds these checks:

- README names the model artifact/version, training window, feature contract,
  output meaning, validation evidence, and re-upload or retraining expectation.
- `alva run` proves the script fetches real data, loads the `.onnx` file from
  ALFS, and builds tensors with the documented shape.
- Public access should normally be granted to released feed outputs, not the
  model artifact.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session or tensor error | Reusing a released session, wrong dtype, or `dims` product differs from data length | Create one session per run and rebuild the tensor from `model_meta.json` |
| Missing graph key | Wrong ONNX input/output name | Use the names from model metadata or runtime introspection, then update code and docs |
| Local preview works but `alva run` fails | Host-file or local-only loading leaked into production | Use `InferenceSession.createFromAlfs({ alfs, path })` with an ALFS model path |
